# Learning a new layout

Should you do it? YES! ðŸ’¯

Assume you have already made your decision, and you are ready to dive in,
you suddenly come to the realization that it is harder than you expected.

Should you give up? NO! ðŸ™…

Here is my experience, and hopefully it can help you along the way.

To set the stage, I'm not a fast typist.
When I use QWERTY, I can type around 60 wpm.

Able to type fast is an important skill as a programmer.

The key is don't let your typing speed interrupt your chain of thought.

IMO, able to type around 90 wpm is ideal.

When I make my jump into [Dygma Defy],
I decided to learn a new keyboard layout.

Not for speed, but for comfort.

So after some research, I decided to learn [Colemak-DH].

(recently I start learning [Engram], but that's a different topic)

To me, it takes me about 2 months to get comfortable with it and switching to it as my daily driver,
and another 1 to 2 months to be able to type decently at around 50 wpm.

So you see, I'm not fast at all, both at typing speed and at learning the layout.
You could do a much better job than me.

## Choosing a layout

To learn a new layout, you first need to choose which layout you want to learn.
That mostly depends on 3 criteria:

> Which language are you working with?

Most of the alternative layouts are designed for a specific language,
mostly English.

So if you use a different language, you may want to look for a layout that is specific for that language.

> How comfortable are you in changing the layout?

Most of us comes from the QWERTY layout.
Some alternative layouts,
for example Colemak,
are designed to make minimal changes to the QWERTY layout and get the most benefit from those changes.

Personally, that was one of the reasons I chose [Colemak-DH].
But after I have learned it, I'm still not sure if that is a benefit or not.

I think this "similarity" can be a two-edge sword.
On one hand, it may make it easier to learn the layout,
but on the other hand, it may make it more difficult to switch between the layouts.

For myself, I sometimes need to switch over to QWERTY when I want to type something quickly on my laptop without the need of pulling out my [Dygma Defy],
or I need to type on someone else's computer.

The more different the layout are, the easier for our brain to switch between them.

But if you think the "similarity" is beneficial to you, feel free to include that into your considerations.

> How popular is the layout? How much adaption does it get?

The popularity of the layout comes into play in terms of two key area:

- Tooling: does it have great tooling support, especially the learning tools?
- Community: choosing the layout is not the end of your decision-making. You are likely need to refine and customize it along the way.
  Especially around the non-alphabet keys (see the next section). Having a good community and following can help you to build a layout that you like.

## Defining your layout

After you choose your layout, you need to define it.

The layout you choose should define the position of all alphabet key,
and optionally the number keys and some symbol keys.

Depends on your keyboard, you may be able to define all the keys you need in one layer.
However, in many cases the keyboard is not a full-size keyboard, and you need to define the keys in multiple layers.

The placement of these non-alphabet keys, as well as the modifier keys, layer shift keys, macro keys, etc.,
are highly personal and subjective.

And most of the time it is not a set-once-and-forget-it thing.
You will continue to tweak the layout along the way, until you find one that you like.

## Learning Tools

There are many tools you can use to learn a new layout.

I personally use two websites:

- [keybr.com]: for a guided practice to learn the keys
- [monkeytype.com]: to improve my typing speed and accuracy after learning the keys

There are many other tools out there, and [monkeytype.com] can also be used to learn keys and vice versa,
but I personally find just these two websites works fine for me.

If you really want to play around and have some fun,
[play.typeracer.com], Epistory - Typing Chronicles,
or The Typing of the Dead: Overkill would be nice addition too.

## Tips and Tricks

Practice, practice, practice. ðŸ˜‚

Learning a new layout is hard.
It's because typing on a keyboard is one of the most complex unconscious skill out there.
And on top of that, you have to fight against the muscle memory you have built up over the years.

Consider learning to play tennis with your other hand (and be good at it).
It's hard, but you are physically using a different hand, and the stroke is just mirrored.

When learning a new keyboard layout, you are using the same fingers on your hands.
The only difference is the mapping within your head.

So be prepared that it will take time.

As for tips and tricks, there is one that I can share: take it show and focus on accuracy.

Since you are training your unconscious mind when you learn a new layout,
every wrong keystroke will confuse and slow down your unconscious mind to rewire the neurons correctly.
It can't really tell if the stroke is correct or not. That's the job of your conscious mind.

It is tempting to go fast, especially when you see your dismal wpm at the end of a typing session.

Don't give in to that temptation.

## 3 Phases of learning a new keyboard layout

I notice 3 distinctive phases in my learning journey.

Identifying which phase you are in can help you gauge how far you are in your learning journey.

The first phase is learning the keys.

At this phase, I look at the words by the characters.
I try to figure out where the key is on the keyboard,
and maybe which finger I should be using to press it.

For me, my wpm is around 20-25 at this phase.

The second phase is typing the characters.

At this phase, I don't have to think about the location of the keys.
I can read the character one by one, and my finger will type the right key.

Once I get to this phase, my wpm jumps to around 35 wpm.
And my brain start relaxing as it doesn't need to locate the keys and validate the right key is being pressed.

The third phase is typing by the words.

This is the phase I become fluent with the layout.
I can use it like normal, even though it can be still slower than what I was with the QWERTY layout.

I still struggle with it from time to time, especially when it comes to symbols.
That's because I didn't get much practice with the symbols,
and it highly depends on the content you want to type.

For example for me, I write a lot of TypeScript code, and also work on ReactJS.

So writing arrow function (`() => { ... }`), and using JSX syntax (`<div>...</div>`) is very common.
And dancing round layers and shift key is very inconvenient to me.
That's why customizing the symbol layer is very important to me.

## Conclusion

So that's what I can share about learning a new keyboard layout.
It helps me a lot in terms of reducing my wrist pain, and I can clearly feel that my fingers are doing less work.
But at the same time, it is not easy.

Despite that, I'd encourage you to give it a try.

Scratch that, I'd recommend you to do it.
Commit to it and follow through.
You will be glad you made the jump.
