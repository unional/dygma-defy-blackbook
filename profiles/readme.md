# Profiles

The [Dygma Defy][defy] is a fully programmable keyboard.
You can create different profiles that work for you.

Here are the profiles that I use:

My current profile:
[Lower row mod Profile ![base colemak-dh layer](./lower-row/layer-1.png)](./lower-row/readme.md)

My first attempt:
[Home row mod Profile ![base colemak-dh layer](./home-row/layer-1.png)](./home-row/readme.md)
