## Adding a switch to the list

If the switch you are looking for is not in the [switch list](../switches/readme.md#switches-list),
it is pretty easy to add one.

1. create a new switch detail page using the [switch template](../switches/_switch_template.md).
2. add a new entry to the [switch list](../switches/readme.md#switches-list).

If you have the switch and can also add a review, follow the next section.

## Adding a switch review

Interested in sharing your review? Excellent üòç

First, take a look at the [switch list](../switches/switches.md) to see if the switch you want to review is already added.
If it is already there, that's great!
All you need to do is adding your rating in the first section, and your review in the `## Reviews` section.

If it has not been added, follow the [adding a switch to the list](#adding-a-switch-to-the-list) instruction to add a new entry.
