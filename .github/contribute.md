## Switch Review

Interested in sharing your review? Excellent üòç

First, take a look at the [switch list](../switches/switches.md) to see if the switch you want to review is already added.
If it is already there, that's great!
All you need to do is adding your rating in the first section, and your review in the `## Reviews` section.

If it has not been added, create a new switch detail page using [the switch template](../switches/_switch_template.md) file and start filling them in.

You can also update the average rating and the summary in the [switch list](../switches/switches.md),
but don't worry too much about it if that it too troublesome.
It will be automated soon.
