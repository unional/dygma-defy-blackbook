# Switch Rating

When choosing a switch,
you can easily overwhelmed by the sea of information attacking you:
type, actuation force, actuation point, bottom out force, total travel,
spring type, spring material, spring length, stem material, housing material, and much more..

To me, it is a lot like choosing a rubber for table tennis paddle:
type of the rubber, thickness of the sponge, bounce of the sponge,
material of the sponge, material of the top sheet, shape of the pimple, etc.

For table tennis rubber, people come up with a rating system to describe the properties of a rubber,
so that we can compare them based on their pros and cons. For example:

| Name                                   | Speed | Spin | Control | Tackiness | Weight | Sponge Hardness | Gears | Throw Angle | Consistency | Durability | Overall |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- | ------- | --------- | ------ | --------------- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Buttertfly Dignics 05                  | 9.1   | 9.4  | 8.8     | 2.0       | 5.1    | 7.0             | 8.3   | 6.4         | 8.6         | 8.4        | 9.2     |
| Butterfly Tenergy 64  FX               | 9.0   | 8.9  | 8.5     | 1.6       | 4.6    | 2.9             | 7.7   | 3.9         | 9.4         | 7.5        | 9.1     |
| DHS Hurricane 3 National (Blue Sponge) | 9.3   | 9.6  | 9.1     | 8.5       | 6.2    | 8.0             | 9.3   | 5.7         | 9.2         | 8.3        | 9.4     |
| Yasaka Anti Power                      | 4.4   | 2.5  | 8.8     | 1.2       | 4.1    | 1.9             | 3.6   | 2.3         | 8.3         | 9.3        | 9.2     |

I think we can do something similar with keyboard switches:

| Total Ratings (1)  | Type    | Force | Speed | Travel | Smoothness | Stability | Crispness | Quietness | Thockiness | Clackiness | Poppiness | RGB | Consistency | Overall |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| Kailh Silent Brown | Tactile | 7.0   | 5.0   | 7.0    | 7.0        | 8.0       | 7.0       | 7.0       | 6.0        | 7.0        | 5.0       | 9.0 | (not rated) | 8.0     |

Every rating is on a scale of 0 to 10.

## Type

This is the type of the switch: Linear, Tactile, or Clicky.

Silent is not considered as a type,
because there are many ways to make a switch silence.
What's important is how [quiet](#quietness) the switch is.
Some switch are not categorized as silent but they are quiet.

## Force

`Force` describes how heavy the switch feels.

For linear switch, this is determined by the spring force.
For tactile and clicky switches, this is determined mostly by the tactile force.

## Speed

`Speed` describes how fast the switch can register your key stroke.

This is determined by 2 factors:

- actuation travel: how much you need to press the switch for it to trigger a signal.\
  Shorter actuation travel means it is faster.
- activation force: the total minimum force needed to reach the actuation point.\
  For linear switches, this is the actuation force.\
  For tactile or clicky switches, this is typically the tactile force.\
  Lower activation force means it is faster.

## Travel

`Travel` describes how deep the switch can travel before bottom-out.

This is determined by the total travel of the switch.
It's basically a normalized scale from the shortest travel (3.0mm) to the longest travel (4.0mm).

## Smoothness

`Smoothness` describes how smooths the switch feels.

This is determined by a number of factors.

Is the stem travel smoothy?
Does the stem has bearing?
Is the switch factory lubed?
What's the quality of the lube?
Is the switch scrachy?
Is the switch wobble (while wobble is primary measured by [stability](#stability) has its own rating, it does affect smoothness)?

## Stability

`Stability` measures how much wobble the switch has.

This is mainly affected by stem wobbling, housing wobbling, and housing fit when installed on the keyboard.

## Crispness

`Crispness` describes how crisps the switch feels when pressed.

Crispness is related to whether the switch has damping mechanism to make it silent,
which could make the switch feels mushy.

There could be other factor like the spring material,
the alternative stem material etc.

## Quietness

`Quietness` measures how quiet the switch is (duh).

## Thockiness

`Thockiness` measures how bassy or low-itch the switch makes.

The more thocky the switch, it makes a more solid and rounded sound.

## Clackiness

`Clackiness` measures how sharp or high-pitch the switch makes.

A clacky switch produces a clear, crisp sound.

## Poppiness

`Poppiness` describes if the switch produces a clear, bouncy click when the key is released.

## RGB

`RGB` describes how well the switch lets the RGB light to shine through.

It is affected by:

- does the switch has a cut-out to let the RGP shine through?
- is the switch top housing transparent?
- does the cut-out have a defuser or matt cover to disperse the light?

## Consistency

`Consistency` measures the rate of broken switches, bended pins, etc., within a purchase.

While it is true that the vendor can also be a contributing factor to `consistency`,
this is nonetheless an importing rating to know about.

## Overall

`Overall` is the overall satisfaction of the switch.
This is mostly a subjective value.

This rating should NOT consider the price. An overpriced product should not get a lower rating.
