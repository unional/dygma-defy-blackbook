# Switch Specification

The switch specification can tell us key information about the switch.

Of course, we don't need to capture everything about the switch.
We only need the information that we need.

Note that not all information we want is available to each switch,
and the specification provided by websites or even in manufactor's specification might not be accurate.

So the information should be used as a reference and we can provide additional notes based on what we observed.

Here is an example of specification for [Kailh Silent Brown](./kailh_silent_brown.md):

## Tactile Force

Tactile force only applies to Tactile or Clicky switches, and it is always greater than Actuation/Operation Force.

## Actuation Force

Actuation Force is also known as Operation Force.
It describes the force act on your finger by the switch at the moment it is activated and send the signal to your computer.

## Buttom-out Force

Sometimes also referred as `Operating Force` on linear switch.

## Return Force

## Tactile Travel

## Actuation Travel

Sometime also referred as `Pre-travel` on linear switch.

## Buttom-out Travel

Also known as `Total travel`.

## Wobble Tolerance

Wobble Tolerance measures stem wobble and typically only can be found in the manufacturer specification of the switch.
