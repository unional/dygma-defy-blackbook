# Switch Specification

The switch specification can tell us key information about the switch.

Of course, we don't need to capture everything about the switch.
We only need the information that we need.

Note that not all information we want is available to each switch,
and the specification provided by websites or even in manufactor's specification might not be accurate.

So the information should be used as a reference and we can provide additional notes based on what we observed.
