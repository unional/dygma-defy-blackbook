# How to choose switches for Defy

The [Dygma Defy][defy] uses mostly [MX switches][mx-switch].
The thumb cluster on each side has 8 keys.
4 of them are [MX switches][mx-switch] while the other 4 are [Kailh Low Profile ChocV1 switches][choc-switch].

Since each of our finger has different strength and dexterity,
potentially we can use 6 (5 fingers + low profile) or more (other variants for far-reaching keys) different switches.

Just kidding ðŸ¤£.

While that is definitely overkill, I think using 3 different switches make the most sense:

- one switch for the main area of the keyboard.
- one [MX switch][mx-switch] for the thumb cluster
- one [Choc switch][choc-switch] for the thumb cluster low profile keys.

The switch for the main area can be either linear or tactile.
Since I am a programmer and have to use the keyboard many hours a day,
I definite prefer lighter switches here to avoid finger fatigue.

The [MX switch][mx-switch] on the thumb cluster will be a heavier tactile switch.
Our thumb is more stable, much stronger, has a wide range of motion,
but also slower and lower in dexterity compare to other fingers.
Since the keys in the thumb cluster are mostly dual-function keys or superkeys,
and currently it is not possible to configure the hold timeout per key,
we need a heavier and more bouncy key in the thumb cluster to minimize the misfire of those keys.

For the [Choc switch][choc-switch] in the thumb cluster,
I currently only use them minimally,
so have not yet form any opinion on what should I put in there.

That's the general direction of what kind of switches I'll cover in this blackbook.
