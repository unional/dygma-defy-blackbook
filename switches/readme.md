# Switches

What is the best keyboard switches in the market?

You can likely guessed it, there is no definitive answer to that question.

The keyboard you use, the keycap, do you have foam, do you custom lube or not, etc., etc.,
all contribute to the final result.

And the most important factor of all, it's about **you**.
What's your typing style? Are you a touch typist? Do you have strong fingers and tend to bottom-out?
Do you like the smoothness of linear switches, or good feedback of tactile or clicky switches?
Do you want your keyboard to be as silence as possible, or you like it thocky, clacky, or poppy?

For me, since I use my [Dygma Defy][defy] in office,
the quiteness of the keyboard is a key consideration.

Of course, any good switches for the [Dygma Defy][defy] have a place in this blackbook.
So it will also have information on those switches,
and if you have your favorite, feel free to add it to the list.
