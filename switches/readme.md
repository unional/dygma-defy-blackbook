# Switches

What is the best keyboard switches in the market?

If you knows a little bit about the mechanical keyboard world,
you know that there is no definitive answer to that question.

The keyboard you use, the keycap, do you have foam, do you custom lube or not, etc., etc.,
all contribute to the final result.

And the most important factor of all, it's about **you**.
What's your typing style? Are you a touch typist? Do you have strong fingers and tend to bottom-out?
Do you like the smoothness of linear switches, or good feedback of tactile or clicky switches?
Do you want your keyboard to be as silence as possible, or you like it thocky, clacky, or poppy?

For me, since I use my [Dygma Defy][defy] in office,
the quiteness of the keyboard is definitely a main consideration.

So the switches you see here are geared towards that.

Of course, any good switches for the [Dygma Defy][defy] have a place in this blackbook.
So it will also have information on those switches,
and if you have your favorite, feel free to add it to the list.

The [Dygma Defy][defy] uses mostly [MX switches][mx-switch].
The thumb cluster on each side has 8 keys.
4 of them are [MX switches][mx-switch] while the other 4 are [Kailh Low Profile ChocV1 switches][choc-switch].

Since each of our finger has different strength and dexterity,
potentially we can use 6 (5 fingers + low profile) or more (other variants for far-reaching keys) different switches.

Just kidding ðŸ¤£.

While that is definitely overkill, I think using 3 different switches make the most sense:

- one switch for the main area of the keyboard.
- one [MX switch][mx-switch] for the thumb cluster
- one [Choc switch][choc-switch] for the thumb cluster low profile keys.

The switch for the main area can be either linear or tactile.
Since I am a programmer and have to use the keyboard many hours a day,
I definite prefer lighter switches here to avoid finger fatigue.

The [MX switch][mx-switch] on the thumb cluster will be a heavier tactile switch.
Our thumb is more stable, much stronger, has a wide range of motion,
but also slower and lower in dexterity compare to other fingers.
Since the keys in the thumb cluster are mostly dual-function keys or superkeys,
and currently it is not possible to configure the hold timeout per key,
we need a heavier and more bouncy key in the thumb cluster to minimize the misfire of those keys.

For the [Choc switch][choc-switch] in the thumb cluster,
I currently only use them minimally,
so have not yet form any opinion on what should I put in there.

That's the general direction of what kind of switches I'll cover in this blackbook.

Below is the table of content in this section,
listing each switch that I (or contributors) have used or interested in,
as well as an overview/deep dive about switches.
